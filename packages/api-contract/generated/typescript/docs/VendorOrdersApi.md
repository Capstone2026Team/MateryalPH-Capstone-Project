## confirmVendorOrder

> OrderDetailEnvelope confirmVendorOrder(orderId, idempotencyKey, vendorOrderConfirmRequest)



Manual confirmation, permitted revision (lower quantities or an order-level discount; never a price increase) and optional manual NRPC. One transaction locks the organization, order and every inventory row in deterministic order, revalidates the store (activation, restriction, public profile), online payment capability, listings, tax classification and stock, and reserves every confirmed line or none (409 STOCK_INSUFFICIENT / STORE_NOT_ELIGIBLE / LINE_NOT_ELIGIBLE). Owner, Manager, Store Staff and Customer Service confirm unchanged orders; revisions and NRPC need Owner, Manager or Store Staff; Site Delivery vehicles, trips and the formula fee need Owner or Manager (409 DELIVERY_FEE_CHANGED if the fee differs from the formula).

### Example

```ts
import {
  Configuration,
  VendorOrdersApi,
} from '@materyalph/api-client-ts';
import type { ConfirmVendorOrderRequest } from '@materyalph/api-client-ts';

async function example() {
  console.log("🚀 Testing @materyalph/api-client-ts SDK...");
  const config = new Configuration({
    // To configure API key authorization: accessCookie
    apiKey: "YOUR API KEY",
    // To configure API key authorization: webCsrf
    apiKey: "YOUR API KEY",
  });
  const api = new VendorOrdersApi(config);

  const body = {
    // string
    orderId: 38400000-8cf0-11bd-b23e-10b96e4ef00d,
    // string
    idempotencyKey: 38400000-8cf0-11bd-b23e-10b96e4ef00d,
    // VendorOrderConfirmRequest
    vendorOrderConfirmRequest: ...,
  } satisfies ConfirmVendorOrderRequest;

  try {
    const data = await api.confirmVendorOrder(body);
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

// Run the test
